# DA_POP_GDP_IMP_EXP
Data Analysis that shows the correlation between HDI index and Populations, GDP, Imports and Exports of selected countries

In this report, I will use 5 datasets from Gapminder. I need to explore the Human development index progress in the world and how it is related to the population in each country as well as how it is related to the value of imports and exports. The following datasets where used:

total_gdp_us_inflation_adjusted
population_total
exports_percent_of_gdp
imports_percent_of_gdp
hdi_human_development_index
The question needs to be answered are:

how the Human development Index is correlated to the selected measures
For the positively correlated measure if any how this correlation is changed by country
